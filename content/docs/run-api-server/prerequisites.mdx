Horizon only has one dependency: a PostgreSQL server that it uses to store data that has been processed and ingested from Stellar Core. Horizon requires PostgreSQL version >= 9.5.

As far as system requirements go, there are a few main things to keep in mind:

- If you plan on [ingesting](./running.mdx#ingesting-transactions) live transaction data from the Stellar network, your machines should have enough extra RAM to hold Captive Core's in-memory database (~3GB).

- In the above case, you should also take care to allocate enough space (on the order of ~20 GBs to your `/tmp` directory for Captive Core to cache ledger information while it runs. You can also set a `TMPDIR` environmental variable ([or equivalent](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#TempDir) for your OS) to change the directory being used, at least until a flag is [introduced](https://github.com/stellar/go/issues/3437) to customize this through Horizon itself.

- Other disk space requirements depend on how much of the network's history you'd like to serve from your Horizon instance; this could be anywhere from a few GBs to tens of TBs for the full ingested pubnet ledger history.
